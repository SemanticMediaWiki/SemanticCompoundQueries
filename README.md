Semantic Compound Queries (a.k.a. SCQ) is a [Semantic Mediawiki][smw] extension that defines the `#compound_query` parser function which can display results of multiple `#ask` queries (as compound construct) at the same time.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.2 or later
- MediaWiki 1.23 or later
- [Semantic MediaWiki][smw] 2.1 or later

## Installation

To install the extension, place the entire `SemanticCompoundQueries` directory
within your MediaWiki `extensions` directory, then add the following
line to your `LocalSettings.php` file:

    require_once "$IP/extensions/SemanticCompoundQueries/SemanticCompoundQueries.php";


The recommended way to install Semantic Compound Queries is by using [Composer][composer]
with an entry in MediaWiki's `composer.json`.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"mediawiki/semantic-compound-queries": "~1.0"
	}
}
```
1. From your MediaWiki installation directory, execute
   `composer require mediawiki/semantic-compound-queries:~1.0`
2. Navigate to _Special:Version_ on your wiki and verify that the package
   have been successfully installed.

## Usage

The syntax of `#compound_query` resembles that of `#ask`, but with more than
one query, and with the elements of each sub-query delimited by semicolons
instead of pipes. Elements that are common across all sub-queries, like
`format=` and `width=` (for maps) should be placed after all sub-queries.

### Example

A sample call to `#compound query`, which retrieves both biographies, along
with their subject; and fiction books, along with their author; is:

```
{{#compound_query:
  [[Category:Books]] [[Has genre::Biography]]
  ;?Covers subject=Subject
  |
  [[Category:Books]] [[Has genre::Fiction]]
  ;?Has author=Author
  |format=list
}}
```
